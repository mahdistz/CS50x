              <p class="paragraph-container">
                Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
                  Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
                  Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.
                  Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

              <p class="paragraph-container">
                Regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do for your health. Being physically active can improve your brain health, help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities.
                  Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefits. Only a few lifestyle choices have as large an impact on your health as physical activity.
                  Everyone can experience the health benefits of physical activity â€“ age, abilities, ethnicity, shape, or size do not matter.
