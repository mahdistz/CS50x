Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 100 is wrong.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: simulations 1000000 is good enough.
